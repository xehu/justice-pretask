<p><strong>Jury Instruction 1</strong></p>
<p>You must weigh all of the evidence and make a determination in accordance with the law. You must make a determination consistent with the law regardless of how you feel about the plaintiff or the defendant.</p>
<p><strong>Jury Instruction 2</strong></p>
<p>here is a summary of the position of the plaintiff and defendants.</p>
<p>The Plaintiff asserts that defendant violated his Eighth Amendment rights by failing to provide him with adequate clothing and blankets for the cold temperatures, by failing to provide for his medical needs following the altercation with another inmate on May 2, 2006, by failing to provide him with outdoor recreation and by failing to keep the administrative segregation unit sanitary.</p>
<p>The Defendants deny these claims in state they took reasonable measures to address the claims brought to their attention.</p>
<p><strong>Jury Instruction 3</strong></p>
<p>This is not an action against the state of California for the Department of Corrections but rather against the individual defendants.</p>
<p><strong>Jury Instruction 4</strong></p>
<p>You must decide each defendant’s case individually. Unless otherwise stated examine the evidence presented in regard to each defendant.</p>
<p><strong>Jury Instruction 5</strong></p>
<p>the Plaintiff brings his case under 42 U.S.C §1983 which provides that any person or persons who acting under the color of state law deprive another of any rights, privileges, or immunities provided by the United States Constitution or by laws of the United States shall be liable to the injured party.</p>
<p><strong>Jury Instruction 6</strong></p>
<p>In order to prove his case under §1983 the Plaintiff must prove each of the following elements by a preponderance of the evidence:</p>
<ol>
<li>The defendant acted under the color of state law and</li>
<li>the act or failure to act of the defendant deprived the plaintiff of his particular mission rights under the United States Constitution as explained in later instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p>A person acts “under color of state law” when the person acts or purports to act in the performance of official duties under any state, county, or municipal law, ordinance or regulation. The parties have stipulated that the defendants acted under color of state law.</p>
<p>If you find the Plaintiff has proven all of the elements of his case you must find for the Plaintiff. It however you find that the Plaintiff has not proven every element of his case then your verdict must be for the defendant.</p>
<p><strong>Jury Instruction 7</strong></p>
<p>Under §1983 the Plaintiff must prove that the defendant’s action was the actionable cause of his injury. When considering this focus on the individual responsibilities and duties of each defendant. In order to deprive another of their constitutional right the defendant must have made an affirmative action, participated in another’s affirmative action or failed to perform an act he is legally required to do.</p>
<p><strong>Jury Instruction 8</strong></p>
<p>The Plaintiff Has the burden of proving his case.</p>
<p>Under the Eighth Amendment, a prisoner has the right to be free from “cruel and unusual</p>
<p>punishment.” In order to prove the defendants deprived the plaintiff of this right, the plaintiff must prove the following additional elements by a preponderance of the evidence:</p>
<p>1. the plaintiff faced a serious need;</p>
<p>2. the defendant was deliberately indifferent to those needs, that is, the</p>
<p>defendant knew of them and disregarded them by failing to take reasonable measures to</p>
<p>address it; and</p>
<p>3. the acts or failure to act of the defendants caused harm to the plaintiff.</p>
<p>“Deliberate indifference” is the conscious choice to disregard the consequences of one’s</p>
<p>acts or omissions.</p>
<p><strong>Jury Instruction 10</strong></p>
<p>when awarding damages you may consider the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The extent of the plaintiff’s injuries</li>
<li>the disability, disfigurement or loss of enjoyment suffered by the plaintiff</li>
<li>the mental physical or emotional pain suffered by the plaintiff</li>
</ol>
<p>It is up to you with the jury to decide what if any damages have been proven. You can award damages which are nominal which cannot exceed one dollar or you may award more including punitive damages or damages meant to punish the defendant and deter them from taking the same action in the future.</p>
